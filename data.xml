<Expertise><p>&nbsp;Research</p> <div>Dr. Bruyaka&rsquo;s research is focused on studying key sources of value creation in organizations including knowledge search (exploration and exploitation), inter-firm collaboration (alliance portfolio diversity), strategic complementarity in mergers and acquisitions, and internationalization (ambidextrous internationalization trajectories). Bruyaka studies implications of firms&rsquo; strategies for their innovation outcomes (academic publications, patents, new product introductions, etc.), economic performance (net income, return on assets, etc.), market value, as well as longevity (firms&rsquo; survival, shut-down, sell-off, etc.). The empirical context of Bruyaka&rsquo;s research includes emerging industries (fiber optics in 1970s, biotechnology in 1980s) and knowledge-driven industries (biopharmaceuticals). Olga Bruyaka has publications in highly regarded academic journals including Strategic Management Journal, Strategic Organization, Journal of Business Ethics, and Information Technology and Management Journal.</div> <div>Originally from Ukraine, Bruyaka received her Bachelor&rsquo;s and Master&rsquo;s degrees at Kiev National Taras Shevchenko University. While doing her studies in Ukraine, Bruyaka worked at Credit Lyonnais (French bank) and at Carbon Consulting International Ukraine Ltd. (Ukrainian company). After winning a French government study grant, Bruyaka went to France to get her Master&rsquo;s degree in Strategic Management, followed by Ph.D. in Management from EM Lyon Business School. While pursuing her Ph.D., Bruyaka worked as a research and teaching assistant and taught courses in Strategic Management, Technology and Innovation Management, and Introduction to Research. After completing her doctorate degree in 2008, Bruyaka came to the U.S. and worked as an Assistant Professor of Management (with focus on strategic management) at Virginia Tech prior to joining West Virginia University in 2015.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Teaching</div> <div>Strategic Management, Global Business Communications, International Business</div></Expertise>

<Expertise><p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Dr. Lan holds a Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics and a Bachelor of Economics in Business Administration from Beijing University of Technology. He has more than ten years working experience in supply chain management (SCM) in some world leading companies, e.g. Kraft, Nabisco, TNT. Within the industrial practices, he had a passion to analyze the whole supply chain process to reduce inventory, lead time and increase efficiency and customer service level. He then attended the Ivy College of Business, Iowa State University where he received his Ph.D. in supply chain management. After that he joined the faculty of the John Chambers College of Business and Economics at WVU.</p> <p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">The fundamental goal of his research in Supply Chain Management (SCM) is to leverage his expertise in mathematical modeling to promote sustainable SCM by incorporating new technologies or techniques. There are two research streams. First, introducing new technologies, e.g. drones or electric vehicles, into the traditional vehicle routing problem (VRP) models and find high quality solutions of the new variants with operational research techniques. The reduction in cost and pollution can mitigate the negative impact of SCM activities. Second, developing more effective metaheuristics with new techniques to solve NP-hard models of VRP.</p> <p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">As an award-winning teacher, Dr. Lan&rsquo;s philosophy of teaching is to help all students to be successful. His industrial experience and expertise in research let him foster students&rsquo; problem-solving strategies in supply chain management. He has taught qualitative and quantitative courses of supply chain management. At the College of Business and Economics he teaches supply chain analytics and supply chain network design.</p> </Expertise>
